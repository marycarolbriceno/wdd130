                Hello, my name is Marycarol Viviana Briceño Ramos, and I am from Maracaibo, Venezuela. I like to
                listen to music, spend time with my family, and enjoy pretty much outdoor activities like biking
                and taking long walks. My first language is Spanish, but I am currently improving my English, and 
                I would like to learn other languages. I love to learn and take on challenges, which is why I am now
                studying programming. I want to learn to create websites and acquire experience to become a good web
                developer.

            <p>Maracaibo It's the capital of Zulia State, the second biggest city in Venezuela. One of the most enchanting aspects of Maracaibo is the Catatumbo lightning. this natural phenomenon is like a never-ending thunderstorm where lightning strikes up to 40 times a minute. Maracaibo is known as the Beloved Land of the Sun, reflecting the warmth of the culture and the warmth of its sunny weather that paint beautiful sunsets over South America's largest lake, Maracaibo Lake.</p>
