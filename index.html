                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Marycarol Viviana Briceño Ramos. I was born in Caracas. Currently, I am living in Maracaibo, 
                    Venezuela. I am the middle child of three girls, and I also have an older brother. A perfect day to me includes 
                    listening to music, spending time with my family, and I enjoy pretty much outdoor activities, so I try every day 
                    to go biking, take long walks, or go to the park with my dog. I am an animal lover, and I currently have one dog 
                    and two cats, all of whom I've adopted. 
                    Another interesting thing about me is that, despite the fact that my first language is Spanish, I am currently improving 
                    my English. I would also like to learn other languages, such as French and Portuguese, but I first want to learn English 
                    perfectly. I love learning, which is why I am now studying programming. My goal is to learn web development and become a 
                    proficient web developer.

                <p>Maracaibo It's the capital of Zulia State, the second biggest city in Venezuela. One of the most enchanting aspects of Maracaibo is the Catatumbo lightning. this natural phenomenon is like a never-ending thunderstorm where lightning strikes up to 40 times a minute. Maracaibo is known as the Beloved Land of the Sun, reflecting the warmth of the culture and the warmth of its sunny weather that paint beautiful sunsets over South America's largest lake, Maracaibo's Lake.</p>
