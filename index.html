                Hello, my name is Marycarol Viviana Briceño Ramos, and I am from Maracaibo, Venezuela. I like to
                listen to music, spend time with my family, and enjoy pretty much outdoor activities like biking
                and taking long walks. My first language is Spanish, but I am currently improving my English, and 
                I would like to learn other languages. I love to learn and take on challenges, which is why I am now
                studying programming. I want to learn to create websites and acquire experience to become a good web
                developer.
