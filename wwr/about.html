                <div class="container">
                    <p>White Water Rafting Company was founded in 1995 by a group of adventurers with a love for speed and adrenaline. Our journeys began with three boats piloted by expert guides in the Grand Canyon. Our desire was to connect with people who shared our passion for rafting, and thanks to our determination, we were able to encourage more people to join and enjoy the expeditions. In the first year, our company grew exponentially, and we ventured to explore new challenges.</p>
                    <img src="images/rafting.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Currently, we offer a wide range of routes that span from the most peaceful paths for those seeking a relaxing afternoon to the most extreme routes, ideal for adrenaline lovers. Thanks to our commitment to providing excellent quality service, we have earned the loyalty of our customers. That’s why our adventurers return every year to live new experiences and create wonderful memories with White Water Rafting.</p>
